## Overview

The eC-Savings (GSave) MiniProgram is a digital savings solution integrated within the GCash application, designed to provide users with a secure, optimized, and seamless savings experience. The project emphasizes simplicity, security, and performance, ensuring users can easily onboard, deposit, and withdraw funds.

## Key Features

- **Account Onboarding**: A streamlined and intuitive process for users to register and verify their savings accounts.
- **Deposit Feature**: Enables users to securely add funds to their eC-Savings account.
- **Continuous Sync**: Established a CI/CD pipeline that continuously synchronizes design changes from Figma to the codebase, ensuring design updates are reflected instantly without manual intervention.
- **Withdrawal Feature:**: Allows users to withdraw funds from their savings with ease.

## Technologies Used

- **MiniProgram**:  Built within the GCash ecosystem for a smooth and integrated experience.
- **Vue.js**: Ensures a responsive, dynamic, and maintainable frontend interface.
- **GCash APIs**: Facilitates secure financial transactions, authentication, and account management.
- **Cebuana Lhuillier APIs**:  Supports cash-in and cash-out transactions via Cebuana Lhuillierâ€™s network.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token) for Data Encryption**:  Ensures that sensitive user data is securely encrypted and transmitted, protecting account and transaction details.

## Development Approach
- **Latest Coding Standards:**:  The application is built using modern best practices, ensuring code maintainability, scalability, and security.
- **Optimized Performance:**:  The app is designed for speed and efficiency, minimizing load times and ensuring a smooth user experience.


## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the generated code was clean and maintainable. This involved setting up intelligent mapping between Figma components and Vue.js code structures, as well as managing edge cases like responsive design and conditional rendering. Additionally, optimizing the application to handle a large volume of users was critical, requiring efficient state management and performance tuning. The continuous synchronization process also needed a robust error-handling system to prevent conflicts during development, particularly when dealing with both GCash and Cebuana Lhuillier (CLRB) APIs, ensuring smooth and reliable transactions.

## Expected Outcome

The eC-Savings (GSave) MiniProgram, soon to be billed in GCash GSave, delivers a clean and maintainable Vue.js codebase, optimized for high user volume, seamless GCash and CLRB API integration, robust error handling, and secure transactions using JWT encryption, ensuring a smooth and efficient savings experience.
